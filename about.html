                    <h1>ABOUT</h1>
                        <p><b>Adventure Holidays in India with Oldest Adventure Tour Company</b>
        Behold! And we will take you on an adventure trip packed with exploration and entertainment, simultaneously working on an adrenaline rush, something you have never felt before. We, 'Pioneers in Adventure Tourism' will guide your path with exciting activities like trekking, climbing, motor biking, jeep safari, bird watching, rafting, skiing, cultural tours, nature walks and camping amidst wilderness, to tuck you and your family or friends in a tailor made haven that will thrill you to pieces.</p>
        <p><b><h4>Some places :</h4></b>1. <b>Rajasthan: </b>Rajasthan might look all artistic and imperial on the face of it, but if you lift that royal veil, you will find its adventurous side that not many know of. Would you fancy soaking in mesmerising views of fortresses and lakes while zip-lining over the sundry landscapes of Jaipur? Nature-lovers can trade their hotel stay with a personalised tent between October and March at Udaipur or Jaisalmer. If you are visiting the lively state during the famous Pushkar Mela, make sure you book yourself a hot air balloon ride to get a bird’s eye view of Jaipur’s marvellous architecture.

            Those who love air-based adventure sports will be happy to know paragliding is now flourishing in Rajasthan. Soar over the golden sands of Jaisalmer, Pushkar and Jhalawar while you are there. Peek into the state’s rich culture while taking a thrilling camel safari or spot a majestic tiger during a jeep safari in The Ranthambore National Park.</p>

            <br><p>2. <b>Goa: </b>Yes, Goa is about lazing all day on the beaches and partying all night long. But it isn’t only about that. If you are a water baby looking for some thrills, Goa will not fail to impress you. Water sports are one of the main tourist attractions in Goa. From the common jet-skiing and parasailing, to the exotic ones such as kayaking and white water rafting, Goa has them all. Spend a day with rich and colourful marine life at Grande island while snorkelling and scuba diving or spot some dolphins at Monkey beach.

                Experience the exhilarating white water rafting in the rapids of The Mhadei River or take an entertaining ride on a tube pulled by a speedboat (ringo ride) at Pindul Cave. Those looking for a wild adventure, can head to the Cortalim jetty and take a boat ride to Cumbharjua canals for watching massive crocodiles. You could also go kayaking in Sal Backwaters or wind surfing at Dona Paula Bay.
